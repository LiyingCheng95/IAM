O	Should you restrict reality TV	It is alright if a child indeed has a talent, and his or her parents do not try to benefit from it.	100_15	0
O	Should you restrict reality TV	However, children who are so far not extraordinary in any way may start experiencing lower self-esteem, comparing themselves to the participants of TV shows.	100_15	0

O	Should we support animal rights	The animal rights movement, sometimes called the animal liberation movement, animal personhood, or animal advocacy movement, is a social movement which seeks an end to the rigid moral and legal distinction drawn between human and non-human animals, an end to the status of animals as property, and an end to their use in the research, food, clothing, and entertainment industries.	16_4	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Terms and factions	16_4	0
C	Should we support animal rights	All animal liberationists believe that the individual interests of non-human animals deserve recognition and protection, but the movement can be split into two broad camps.	16_4	1
O	Should we support animal rights	Animal rights advocates, or rights liberationists, believe that these basic interests confer moral rights of some kind on the animals, and/or ought to confer legal rights on them;[1] see, for example, the work of Tom Regan.	16_4	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Utilitarian liberationists, on the other hand, do not believe that animals possess moral rights, but argue, on utilitarian grounds — utilitarianism in its simplest form advocating that we base moral decisions on the greatest happiness of the greatest number — that, because animals have the ability to suffer, their suffering must be taken into account in any moral philosophy.	16_4	0
O	Should we support animal rights	To exclude animals from that consideration, they argue, is a form of discrimination that they call speciesism; see, for example, the work of Peter Singer [ref].	16_4	0

O	Should we support animal rights	They see the promotion of veganism as a low-opportunity cost means of creating an antispeciesist culture and posing an economic threat to the animal agriculture industrial complex [ref].	16_4	0
O	Should we support animal rights	The direct action or militant faction includes in its repertoire of contention property damage, open releases, intimidation, and direct violence.	16_4	0
O	Should we support animal rights	With these, they offer a prognosis to the problem of animal use that focuses on changing society through force and fear.	16_4	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Animal rights actors often reject this faction, pointing to violence as a counterproductive tactic that invites repression (e.g., the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act) and does not economically or politically challenge extant systems [ref].	16_4	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Smaller factions include groups focused around faith-based animal rights theory and veganarchists, whose approach is characterized by a critique of capitalism on the grounds that it has led to mass nonhuman, human, and environmental exploitation [ref].	16_4	0

O	Should we support animal rights	History	16_4	0

O	Should we support animal rights	Other early influences include: Upton Sinclair's 1906 novel The Jungle, which drew attention to obscured slaughterhouse operations; Henry Salt's treatises on nonhuman animal rights; which drew from human abolitionist arguments for recognizing personhood of people considered to be property; and the Alcott House of New England, a community serving as a stop on the Underground Railroad and requiring its residents to eat a vegan diet [ref].	16_4	0
O	Should we support animal rights	The contemporary movement is regarded as having been founded in the UK in the early 1970s by a group of Oxford university post-graduate philosophy students, now known as the Oxford Group [ref].	16_4	0
O	Should we support animal rights	The group was led by Rosalind and Stanley Godlovitch, graduate students of philosophy who had recently become vegetarians.	16_4	0
O	Should we support animal rights	The Godlovitches met John Harris and David Wood, also philosophy graduates, who were soon persuaded of the arguments in favour of animal rights and themselves became vegetarian.	16_4	0
O	Should we support animal rights	The group began to actively raise the issue with pre-eminent Oxford moral philosophers, including Professor Richard Hare, both personally and in lectures.	16_4	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Their approach was based not on sentimentality (kindness to dumb animals'), but on the moral rights of animals.	16_4	0
O	Should we support animal rights	They soon developed (and borrowed) a range of powerful arguments in support of their views, so that Oxford clinical psychologist Richard Ryder, who was shortly to become part of the group, writes that rarely has a cause been so rationally argued and so intellectually well armed [ref].	16_4	0
O	Should we support animal rights	It was a 1965 article by novelist Brigid Brophy in The Sunday Times which was pivotal in helping to spark the movement.	16_4	0

O	Should we support animal rights	The philosophers found this article and were inspired by its vigorous unsentimental polemic.	16_4	0
O	Should we support animal rights	At about the same time, Ryder wrote three letters to the Daily Telegraph in response to Brophy's arguments [ref].	16_4	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Brophy read Ryder's letters and put him in touch with the Godlovitches and John Harris, who had begun to plan a book about the issue which was also partly inspired by Brophy's polemic.	16_4	0
O	Should we support animal rights	The philosophers had also been to see Brophy about the possibility of a book of essays on the subject [ref].	16_4	0
O	Should we support animal rights	They initially thought that a book with contributions from Brophy, Ruth Harrison, Maureen Duffy and other well-known writers might be of interest to publishers, but after an initial proposal was turned down by the first publisher they approached, Giles Gordon of Victor Gollancz suggested that the work would be more viable if it included their own writing.	16_4	0
O	Should we support animal rights	This was the idea that became Animals, Men and Morals' (see below).	16_4	0
O	Should we support animal rights	In 1970, Ryder coined the phrase speciesism, first using it in a privately printed pamphlet to describe the assignment of value to the interests of beings on the basis of their membership of a particular species [ref].	16_4	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Ryder subsequently became a contributor to Animals, Men and Morals: An Inquiry into the Maltreatment of Non-humans (1972), edited by John Harris and the Godlovitches, a work that became highly influential [ref], as did Rosalind Godlovitch's essay Animal and Morals, published the same year.	16_4	0

O	Should we support animal rights	The movement predominately comprises upper-class and middle-class white female members, owing this to its associations with the Victorian English animal protection movement and American feminism and environmentalism movements [ref].	16_4	0
O	Should we support animal rights	As such, the movement is widely associated in public spheres with women, femininity, and effeminacy.	16_4	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Public perception of the movement is influenced by gendered evaluations; movement outsiders tend to view activists as irrational by virtue of overly emotional sentiments.	16_4	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Aware of this, activists have strategically incorporated men into positions of leadership and theory production, in order to legitimate the movement and counter popular beliefs about the primacy of emotion in the animal rights movement.	16_4	0
O	Should we support animal rights	This tactic relies on the popular perception of men as rational and not given to emotion, and follows a trend in social movement activism that seeks to counter traditional associations with femininity and private spheres by emphasizing rationality, rights, and justice [ref].	16_4	0
O	Should we support animal rights	In one case study, targets of anti-hunting activism used class and gender markers to evaluate activists' claims.	16_4	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Hunters' associations of irrationality with femininity and of inexperience in hunting and wilderness with white-collar positions constituted the reasons for their dismissal of activists' claims.	16_4	0

O	Should we support animal rights	It has been noted that the composition of the movement may discourage the mobilization of particular demographics.	16_4	0
O	Should we support animal rights	A content analysis of magazine covers from highly visible animal rights organizations (PeTA and VegNews) revealed that most featured members were white, female, and thin.	16_4	0
O	Should we support animal rights	With this, and with the composition of the movement being mostly white, female, and thin, it has been suggested that animal rights media depict an activist ideal-type with such characteristics, and that this may mobilize thin white females while deterring others.	16_4	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Racialized, sexualized, and size-focused campaign tactics may also serve to deter potential members from joining the movement.	16_4	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Racialized tactics include the appropriation of African slavery and Holocaust language and imagery, and have been deemed insensitive and impugned by nonwhite communities.	16_4	0
O	Should we support animal rights	In addition, the movement has maintained racist stereotypes about nonwhite individuals' predisposition toward animal cruelty; these stereotypes arose in post-slavery U.S. and Britain, where nonwhites were deemed by law and by society to have a tendency toward animal cruelty.	16_4	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Sexualization of ideal women is used as a mobilization tactic, but reduces support for ethics-based campaigns and may be counterproductive, alienating women that do not have ideal body types.	16_4	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Sizeism is used as a tactic to frame veganism as a healthy and positive lifestyle, aligning with a popular association of fatness with moral failure.	16_4	0
O	Should we support animal rights	These tactics may contribute to gender inequality because unrealistic and sexualized representations of women are linked to their societal devaluation.	16_4	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Its lack of diverse membership may decrease the movement's legitimacy and ability to mobilize, as members of marginalized groups are more likely to mobilize when they are represented in the movement.	16_4	0

O	Should you subsidize biofuels	Biofuel	89_1	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	A biofuel is a fuel that is produced through contemporary processes from biomass, rather than a fuel produced by the very slow geological processes involved in the formation of fossil fuels, such as oil.	89_1	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	Since biomass technically can be used as a fuel directly (e.g.	89_1	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	wood logs), some people use the terms biomass and biofuel interchangeably.	89_1	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	More often than not however, the word biomass simply denotes the biological raw material the fuel is made of, or some form of thermally/chemically altered solid end product, like torrefied pellets or briquettes.	89_1	0

O	Should you subsidize biofuels	Renewable biofuels generally involve contemporary carbon fixation, such as those that occur in plants or microalgae through the process of photosynthesis.	89_1	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	Some argue that biofuel can be carbon-neutral because all biomass crops sequester carbon to a certain extent – basically all crops move CO2 from above-ground circulation to below-ground storage in the roots and the surrounding soil.	89_1	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	For instance, McCalmont et al.	89_1	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	found below-ground carbon accumulation ranging from 0.42 to 3.8 tonnes per hectare per year for soils below Miscanthus x giganteus energy crops [ref], with a mean accumulation rate of 1.84 tonne (0.74 tonnes per acre per year) [ref],  or 20% of total harvested carbon per year [ref].	89_1	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	However, the simple proposal that biofuel is carbon-neutral almost by definition has been superseded by the more nuanced proposal that for a particular biofuel project to be carbon neutral, the total carbon sequestered by the energy crop's root system must compensate for all the above-ground emissions (related to this particular biofuel project).	89_1	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	This includes any emissions caused by direct or indirect land use change.	89_1	0

O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	First, Internet technology renders prohibitionfutile.	45_10	0
O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	The Internet's inherently open architecture alreadyhobbles law enforcement officials, while relentless technologicalinnovation ensures that they will only fall farther and fartherbehind.	45_10	0
O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Second, as an international network, theInternet offers an instant detour around merely domesticprohibitions.	45_10	0
O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Principles of national sovereignty willprevent the U.S. from forcing other countries to enforce a ban onInternet gambling, and it takes only one safe harbor abroad toensure that U.S. citizens can gamble over the Internet.	45_10	0
O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Third, consumer demand for Internet gamblingand the states' demand for tax revenue will create enormouspolitical pressure for legalization.	45_10	0
O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	The law enforcementcommunity, which has until recently enjoyed the media spotlight,will quickly find its calls for prohibition drowned out by theseand other political forces.	45_10	0
O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Since the hard, cold facts about the inevitable failure ofprohibition will undoubtedly depress some decent andwell-intentioned people, I will leaven my analysis with somecomforting words about Internet gambling.	45_10	0

O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Before launching into the details of why legalization will trumpthe prohibition of Internet gambling, and why that outcome shouldcause no great alarm, allow me to clear away a preliminaryobjection.	45_10	0
O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Some proponents of a ban on Internet gambling argue thatif prohibition will not work then neither will any scheme ofregulation.	45_10	0
O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	(1)Such anargument fundamentally misunderstands a basic principle ofgovernance, however: Regulations can succeed evenwhere prohibition fails if they offer benefits that exceed theirburdens.	45_10	0
O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	That is why people do not illegally shoot craps inLas Vegas alleys.	45_10	0
O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	In the case of Internet gambling, the benefits ofwinning an official stamp of approval might convince an onlinecasino to submit to regulation, even if that same casino couldeasily flout a total ban on its business.	45_10	0

O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	In alllikelihood, not very much--but only practical experience can settlethat question.	45_10	0
O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Internet Technology Renders ProhibitionFutile	45_10	0
O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	The very architecture of the Internet renders gamblingprohibition futile.	45_10	0
O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	In contrast to telephone communications, whichtypically travel over circuit switched networks, Internetcommunications use packet switching.	45_10	0
O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Each Internet message getsbroken into discrete packets, which travel over various andunpredictable routes until received and reassembled at themessage's destination.	45_10	0
O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	In other words, sending a message over theInternet is a bit like corresponding with someone by writing aletter, chopping it up, and mailing each piece separately to thesame address.	45_10	0
O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	The recipient can piece it together but anyonesnooping on your correspondence has a tougher go of it.	45_10	0
O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Understanding Internet communications as akinto the postal system clarifies why gambling prohibition just willnot work.	45_10	0
O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Imagine telling the postal service that it musthenceforth crack down on all letters conveying information used inillegal gambling.	45_10	0

O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	People use bet and wager in everyday conversationswhereas gamblers often speak in code.	45_10	0
O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Meanwhile, customers of themail service will strongly object to having the postal service pawthrough their correspondence.	45_10	0
O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Nor can prohibitionists expect the postal service to simply stopdelivering mail to and from certain addresses associated withillegal gambling.	45_10	0
O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	The postal service will again object to theburdens of implementing such a program.	45_10	0
O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Citizens will again objectto law enforcement officials spying on private correspondence.	45_10	0
O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Moreimportantly, though, trying to cut off certainaddresses will simply fail to stop gambling.	45_10	0
O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Gamblers willrely on P.O.	45_10	0

O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	All these considerations apply with equal or greater force toInternet gambling.	45_10	0
O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Compared to the postal system,the Internet makes it easier to encrypt messages, to changeaddresses, and to send and receive messages anonymously.Internet service providers would thus find it impossible todiscriminate between illicit gaming information and other Internettraffic.	45_10	0
O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Furthermore, in contrast to the quasi-public andmonolithic postal system, the Internet relies onthousands of separate and wholly private service providers to carryout its deliveries.	45_10	0

O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	More than a fewwould simply refuse to cooperate.	45_10	0
O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Does that sound like a pessimistic account?	45_10	0

O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Astechnological innovation continues to drive the development ofInternet communications, law enforcement officials will fallfarther and farther behind illegal gamblers.	45_10	0
O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Given these technological constraints, prohibiting Internetgambling plainly will not work as intended.	45_10	0
O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	As an unintended sideeffect, however, prohibition would sorelycompromise the cost, efficiency, and security of Internetcommunications.	45_10	0
O	Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Given the inevitable failure of technicalfixes, legalizing Internet gambling offers the only viablesolution.	45_10	0

O	Should we ban human cloning	Consider the relationship between ethical positions on the moral status (or dignity) of the cloned embryo and NRC.	44_8	0
O	Should we ban human cloning	The cloned embryo could be considered to have full, no, or limited moral status [18, 35].	44_8	0
O	Should we ban human cloning	The full status position would grant the embryo the same level of moral duties as you or I.	44_8	0
O	Should we ban human cloning	The no status position would grant the embryo no more status or dignity than your hair or nails.	44_8	0
O	Should we ban human cloning	The limited status position would grant the embryo a fixed or gradualist level of intrinsic moral value between these two extremes.	44_8	0
O	Should we ban human cloning	The full status position will require the prohibition of NRC (destructive use of embryos is considered murder) and the no status position will usually require NRC to be permitted (unless such an approach will interfere with the moral interests of those who do matter).	44_8	0
O	Should we ban human cloning	The limited status position is, however, potentially compatible with either regulatory position, depending on the particular status given to the early embryo and the weight given to potential benefits of NRC.	44_8	0
O	Should we ban human cloning	It follows that the fact that the regulatory position permits or prohibits NRC does not do even tell us what status the embryo is considered to have.	44_8	0

O	Should we ban human cloning	Similarly, the existing positions on RC could be supported by radically different ethical views.	44_8	0
O	Should we ban human cloning	Prohibitions could be supported by those who hold that RC is absolutely wrong (eg always violates human dignity) and by those who hold that cloning at present would be wrong.	44_8	0
O	Should we ban human cloning	Even time-limited prohibition does not enable us to discern whether it is underpinned by, for example, the view that RC is wrong because of current safety issues or the view that RC is not wrong but the most effective way to get there is by initially prohibiting it.	44_8	0
O	Should we ban human cloning	In sum, the majority of regulatory outcomes could be coherently explained by reference to one or more underlying ethical positions.	44_8	0
