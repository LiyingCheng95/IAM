C	Should you invest in renewable technologies	U.S. News and World Report examined the issue in an August 22 article, and found that among the five most common energy sources, solar caused the least amount of bird deaths per year, while coal caused the largest amount.	47_15	1
O	Should you invest in renewable technologies	Though the article emphasizes that bird fatalities from renewable energy are less than bird fatalities from other forms of energy, it also shows that the data available on the matter is really not that good.	47_15	0
O	Should you invest in renewable technologies	Reporter Alan Neuhauser gathered data about bird deaths where it was available, from government agencies, academic institutions, nonprofit organizations, and governmental laboratories, including the Bureau of Land Management, solar company BrightSource, and the journal Biological Conservation.	47_15	0
O	Should you invest in renewable technologies	According to the data, while solar is estimated to cause 1,000 to 28,000 bird deaths annually, and wind 140,000 to 328,000, coal kills far more – about 7.9 million birds a year!	47_15	0

O	Is science a threat to mankind	A number of 20th century philosophers maintained that logical models of pure science do not apply to actual scientific practice.	103_6	0
O	Is science a threat to mankind	It was the publication of Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions in 1962, however, which fully opened the study of science to new disciplines by suggesting that the evolution of science was in part sociologically determined and that it did not operate under the simple logical laws put forward by the logical positivist school of philosophy.	103_6	0
O	Is science a threat to mankind	Kuhn described the development of scientific knowledge not as a linear increase in truth and understanding, but as a series of periodic revolutions which overturned the old scientific order and replaced it with new orders (what he called paradigms).	103_6	0
O	Is science a threat to mankind	Kuhn attributed much of this process to the interactions and strategies of the human participants in science rather than its own innate logical structure.	103_6	0
O	Is science a threat to mankind	(See sociology of scientific knowledge and Theories and sociology of the history of science).	103_6	0
O	Is science a threat to mankind	Some interpreted Kuhn's ideas to mean that scientific theories were, either wholly or in part, social constructs, which many interpreted as diminishing the claim of science to representing objective reality (though many social constructivists do not put forward this claim), and that reality had a lesser or potentially irrelevant role in the formation of scientific theories.	103_6	0

O	Is science a threat to mankind	Some more radical philosophers, such as Paul Feyerabend, argued that scientific theories were themselves incoherent and that other forms of knowledge production (such as those used in religion) served the material and spiritual needs of their practitioners with equal validity as did scientific explanations.	103_6	0
O	Is science a threat to mankind	Imre Lakatos advanced a midway view between the postmodernist and realist camps.	103_6	0
O	Is science a threat to mankind	For Lakatos, scientific knowledge is progressive; however, it progresses not by a strict linear path where every new element builds upon and incorporates every other, but by an approach where a core of a research program is established by auxiliary theories which can themselves be falsified or replaced without compromising the core.	103_6	0
O	Is science a threat to mankind	Social conditions and attitudes affect how strongly one attempts to resist falsification for the core of a program, but the program has an objective status based on its relative explanatory power.	103_6	0
O	Is science a threat to mankind	Resisting falsification only becomes ad-hoc and damaging to knowledge when an alternate program with greater explanatory power is rejected in favor of another with less.	103_6	0
O	Is science a threat to mankind	But because it is changing a theoretical core, which has broad ramifications for other areas of study, accepting a new program is also revolutionary as well as progressive.	103_6	0
O	Is science a threat to mankind	Thus, for Lakatos the character of science is that of being both revolutionary and progressive; both socially informed and objectively justified.	103_6	0

O	Is science a threat to mankind	In 1996, Social Text, a Duke University publication of postmodern critical theory, compiled a Science Wars issue containing brief articles by postmodernist academics in the social sciences and the humanities, that emphasized the roles of society and politics in science.	103_6	0
O	Is science a threat to mankind	In the introduction to the issue, the Social Text editor, Andrew Ross, said that the attack upon science studies was a conservative reaction to reduced funding for scientific research, characterizing the Flight from Science and Reason conference as an attempted linking together a host of dangerous threats: scientific creationism, New Age alternatives and cults, astrology, UFO-ism, the radical science movement, postmodernism, and critical science studies, alongside the ready-made historical specters of Aryan-Nazi science and the Soviet error of Lysenkoism that degenerated into name-calling.	103_6	0
O	Is science a threat to mankind	The historian Dorothy Nelkin characterised Gross and Leavitt’s vigorous response as a call to arms in response to the failed marriage of Science and the State — in contrast to the scientists’ historical tendency to avoid participating in perceived political threats, such as creation science, the animal rights movement, and anti-abortionists’ attempts to curb fetal research .	103_6	0

O	Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	Globally, the nexus between migration and development has remained an issue under vigorous academic debate [1–6].	18_6	0
O	Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	Therefore, the process of people migrating to other areas in search of a better life is not a novel one.	18_6	0
O	Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	What has however gained currency is the increasing voluntary movement in quest of better quality of life by low-skill and low-wage workers as well as high-skill and high-wage workers from less developed rural areas to more developed urban areas, especially among the poor in the developing countries [7–10].	18_6	0
O	Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	In this regard, rural-urban migration results from the search for perceived or real opportunities as a consequence of rural-urban inequality in wealth [11, 12].	18_6	0
O	Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	This inequality and/or urban bias in development according to research findings over the years results from the overwhelming concentration of wealth, assets, purchasing capacity, economic activities, and variety of services in the urban centres as well as the continued neglect and degradation of rural environments or areas [13–26].	18_6	0
O	Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	Migration has also been identified as a survival strategy utilized by the poor, especially the rural dwellers.	18_6	0
O	Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	The assessment of the effects of migration on rural areas has remained relevant since migration acts as a catalyst in the transformation process of not only the destiny of individual migrants but also the conditions of family members left behind, local communities, and the wider sending regions.	18_6	0
O	Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	One significant source of development for the rural populace as a result of this increasing drift towards the cities is remittances.	18_6	0
C	Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	Recently, migrants’ remittances and the income multipliers they create are becoming critical resources for the sustenance strategies of receiving households as well as agents of regional and national development [27].	18_6	-1

Households that receive these remittances tend to use the proceeds primarily for current consumption (food, clothing) as well as investments in children’s education, health care, improvement in household food and security, and water and sanitation.	18_6	0
O	Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	Nevertheless, the ability of remittances to compensate the labour shortage in rural areas is still a function of the amounts and value of remittances received by migrants’ households at home, especially in the developing countries [27].	18_6	0
O	Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	Consequently, the effects of rural-urban migration in the rural places of origin of migrants may be manifest in two ways.	18_6	0
O	Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	First, the rural-urban migrants send remittances to their relatives in the rural areas and these remittance-receiving households use the remittances for various purposes.	18_6	0
O	Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	Secondly, these rural-urban migrants execute various rural developmental projects in their rural areas of origin.	18_6	0
O	Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	In Nigeria, most migrants coming from a particular rural community to live in an urban area usually form rural community associations in the urban area.	18_6	0
O	Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	These community associations in the urban areas articulate, from time to time, the developmental needs of their rural communities of origin and contribute resources to execute projects such as road construction and the award of educational scholarships to students in the rural areas.	18_6	0
O	Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	A combination of these rural community projects executed by the rural-urban migrants and the uses of remittances by rural remittance-receiving households serve as indicators of the effects of rural-urban migration on the population concerned.	18_6	0
O	Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	In this regard, and in tandem with contemporary praxis, the paradigm shift in the meaning of development emphasizes personal satisfaction consequent on improvement in the quality of life of the “individual” and/or “population” involved in the developmental process [28].	18_6	0
O	Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	Accordingly, each population ranks community developmental projects and uses of remittances in the order of importance they believe will ensure their satisfaction and happiness.	18_6	0
O	Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	It is also the existence of these projects and the uses of remittances derivable from the migration process that reflect the level of socioeconomic development that can be traceable to rural-urban migration [29].	18_6	0
O	Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	Therefore, the combination of these projects by migrants and the various uses of remittances in the past three years, according to the respondents, are what they see as indicators of development in their rural communities.	18_6	0
O	Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	In different parts of the world, Nigeria inclusive, research has been carried out on the effects of migration on the migrants’ rural communities of origin.	18_6	0

Furthermore, the National Living Standard Survey (NLSS) (2004) data collected for rural Nigeria has been used to estimate a multinomial logit model of the economic and demographic determinants of migration and receipt of remittances in rural Nigeria [46].	18_6	0
O	Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	From the review of the literature, it is clear that most of the rural-urban migration studies done in Nigeria virtually excluded the effects of these rural-urban migrations on the rural sending communities and are in most cases sample surveys on characteristics and determinants of migration.	18_6	0
O	Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	There is, therefore, a need for studies that will determine the effects of rural-urban migration on rural communities in developing countries especially in Nigeria where rural-urban migration has been on the increase in recent times.	18_6	0

O	Should we ban smoking in public places	This debate has long been characterized by the public health and tobacco control communities on one side and the tobacco industry, supported by hospitality industry organizations, many of which have been established by tobacco companies to voice opposition to a ban.	65_2	0
O	Should we ban smoking in public places	The alignment of forces is, however, changing as the voice of the general public is at last being heard.	65_2	0
O	Should we ban smoking in public places	Contrary to the myths that have been peddled by the tobacco industry, public consultations are revealing the true extent to which the British people oppose being subjected to second-hand smoke.	65_2	0
C	Should we ban smoking in public places	For example, the ‘Big Smoking Debate’ organized by the London Health Commission involving over 30 000 respondents indicated that the vast majority (76 per cent) wanted completely smoke free public places, including both smokers and non-smokers.2	65_2	1
O	Should we ban smoking in public places	These findings are unsurprising, given the unpleasant physical effects of exposure to concentrated tobacco smoke.	65_2	0
C	Should we ban smoking in public places	However, public opinion is also being galvanized by growing recognition of the adverse health effects of second-hand smoke, something the tobacco industry has striven hard to refute as part of a campaign sustained over many years to prevent the introduction of bans on smoking in public places.	65_2	1
C	Should we ban smoking in public places	There is now an overwhelming consensus among independent tobacco researchers that exposure to second-hand smoke causes many deaths, with recent research using more precise measures of exposure revealing how exposure to second-hand smoke is considerably more dangerous than was previously believed.3 This is consistent with recently discovered tobacco industry documents showing that second-hand smoke is even more harmful, volume for volume, than directly inhaled smoke.4 Yet the industry continues to place the highest priority on preventing the introduction of restrictions on smoking in public places and has been especially active in spreading misinformation about the effects of the bans in Ireland and New York.	65_2	1
C	Should we ban smoking in public places	The main reason it has pursued this policy with such tenacity is clear; bans, together with increased taxation, are the most effective ways of reducing smoking overall.5 However, it is also concerned that to concede that second-hand smoke is harmful would undermine its argument that smoking is a matter of personal choice.	65_2	1
O	Should we ban smoking in public places	The strategy pursued by the industry has several elements.	65_2	0
O	Should we ban smoking in public places	One, now largely discredited, has been to attack the link between second-hand smoking and disease has included commissioning research, some of which was fraudulent and some simply designed to mislead, undermining the communication of research showing the harm caused by second-hand smoke, and lobbying governments and regulators.6,7	65_2	0
O	Should we ban smoking in public places	Another is to argue that any irritation (again denying the possibility of harm) can be dealt with by ventilation.	65_2	0
C	Should we ban smoking in public places	This too is incorrect, with extensive evidence that the force of ventilation that would be required is far beyond the capacity of existing systems and would be similar to sitting outside during a gale.8 It is important to be aware that many harmful components of tobacco smoke are odourless and the tobacco industry has put much effort into masking the smell and visibility of environmental tobacco smoke.9	65_2	1
O	Should we ban smoking in public places	The third argument, and one with which it has had some success so far in the United Kingdom, is that the introduction of smoking bans in bars and restaurants will reduce takings, and thus sales tax and employment.	65_2	0
O	Should we ban smoking in public places	To sustain this, it has engaged in a wide-ranging campaign directed at the hospitality industry.	65_2	0
O	Should we ban smoking in public places	Yet, like its other arguments, this too is false.	65_2	0
O	Should we ban smoking in public places	The most recent evidence is from New York where, in the 9 months after a ban on smoking in public places was introduced, sales tax receipts on food and drink increased by 12 per cent and employment in the hospitality industry increased.10 However, the most convincing evidence comes from a systematic review of research on the impact of bans on bar and restaurant revenue.11 The details results merit study.	65_2	0
O	Should we ban smoking in public places	The authors examined 97 studies of the economic impact of smoking bans.	65_2	0
O	Should we ban smoking in public places	Every one of the 37 studies finding a negative economic impact had been funded by the tobacco industry or written by consultants known to have industry links; these papers were 20 times as likely as those finding either no effect or an economic benefit to appear other than in a peer reviewed journal.	65_2	0
O	Should we ban smoking in public places	In total, 94 per cent of the tobacco industry supportedstudies reported a negative economic impact.	65_2	0
O	Should we ban smoking in public places	However, this was found in none of the 60 independent studies.	65_2	0
O	Should we ban smoking in public places	The authors concluded that all of the best designed studies report no impactor a positive impact of smoke-free restaurant and bar laws on sales or employment and urged policymakers to protect workers and patrons from the effects of second-hand smoke, confident in the knowledge that industry claims of an adverse economic impact have no basis in fact.	65_2	0
O	Should we ban smoking in public places	The case for action therefore seems overwhelming.	65_2	0
O	Should we ban smoking in public places	Yet we have been struck by the fatalistic believe among both the public and health professionals that nothing can be done.	65_2	0

O	Should we ban smoking in public places	The only thing that is missing is the high level political commitment that there has been in places like New York and Ireland.	65_2	0

O	Should we ban smoking in public places	A first step is to ensure that all health facilities are smoke free; that some hospitals now under construction should actually be building smoking rooms is an indictment on our profession.12 However, there is also a need for us all to counter the mythology perpetuated by the tobacco industry, whether it is in our discussions with national and local politicians, the voluntary sector, the media, or those in the hospitality industry.	65_2	0

O	Will artificial intelligence replace humans	You feed it data – images and labels – and it's supposed to learn the pattern of how you go from an image to a label.	5_12	0
O	Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Unsupervised learning is when you feed it just the images, no labels, continues Abbeel.	5_12	0
O	Will artificial intelligence replace humans	You hope that from just seeing a lot of images that it starts to understand what the world tends to look like and then by building up that understanding, maybe in the future it can learn something else more quickly.	5_12	0

O	Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Just feed it a lot of data (as Google did with lots of cats).	5_12	0

O	Will artificial intelligence replace humans	(Reinforcement learning is credited for advancements in self-driving car technology.)	5_12	0
O	Will artificial intelligence replace humans	It's when you give your system a goal.	5_12	0

O	Will artificial intelligence replace humans	What makes me very excited about what we're doing right now at Embodied Intelligence is that the recent events in artificial intelligence have given AI the ability to understand what they are seeing in pictures, says Abbeel.	5_12	0

O	Will artificial intelligence replace humans	As Brooks notes, what was considered AI in the 1960s is now taught in the very first course on computer programming.	5_12	0
O	Will artificial intelligence replace humans	But it's not called AI.	5_12	0
O	Will artificial intelligence replace humans	It's called AI at some point, says Brooks.	5_12	0
O	Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Then later it just becomes computer science.	5_12	0
O	Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Machine learning, and all of its variations, including deep learning, reinforcement learning and imitation learning, are subsets of AI.	5_12	0
O	Will artificial intelligence replace humans	AI was a very narrow field for a while.	5_12	0
O	Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Some people saw it very specifically around a set of search-based techniques, explains Goldberg.	5_12	0
O	Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Now AI is widely seen as an umbrella term over robotics and machine learning, so now it's being embraced as a whole range of subfields.	5_12	0
O	Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Advanced forms of computer vision are a form of AI.	5_12	0
O	Will artificial intelligence replace humans	If you're just inspecting whether a screw is in the right place, we've had that since the '60s.	5_12	0
O	Will artificial intelligence replace humans	It would be a stretch to call that AI, explains Goldberg.	5_12	0
O	Will artificial intelligence replace humans	But at the same time, a computer vision system that can recognize the faces of workers, we generally do think of that as AI.	5_12	0

O	Should you subsidize biofuels	A new issue now tops EU biofuels debates: subsidies.	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	First reports suggest that EU biofuels policy is costly, and that subsidies paid to biofuel producers are lush.	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	A fuller exploration of the economics (and subsidies) of EU biofuels reveals that biofuels are among the best economic development – and cheapest carbon abatement – vehicles we have.	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	In other words, the biofuels industry welcomes a serious economic debate.	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	Unfortunately, serious debate is unlikely if the past is any guide.	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	Earlier the year, the main issue was land-grabbing, a potent and even stomach-wrenching argument whose only flaw is that there really isn't any, absolutely zero, land-grabbed biofuel being exported to Europe.	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	While the facts of land-grabbing prove that EU biofuels policy was unfairly maligned by NGOs on this issue, the public has never received this update.	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	Prior to that, the major issue was food v fuel, driven by inexorable rises in food prices coinciding with biofuels mandates.	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	The first major problem with that argument is that science increasingly rejects it, and the best available science (accepted by the European Commission) concludes that EU biofuels mandates are responsible for about a 1%-2% increase in corn, wheat and sugar prices over an entire decade.	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	The second major problem is that corn and wheat aren't actually expensive.	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	While NGOs were quick to point out a spike in corn prices last summer, none have bothered to point out that the corn price has quietly and steadily fallen; and is now lower than before the drought.	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	One other fact also not well publicised, according to Oxfam's own methodology, is that the cost to feed someone for an entire year on Hungarian-grown biofuel feedstock would be €0.09/day at today's prices.	89_9	0
C	Should you subsidize biofuels	European biofuels provide jobs to the poorest communities in Europe, encourage agricultural investments, and provide a reason for farmland to be farmed, thereby helping (without subsidies) to stop a two decade decline in agriculture.	89_9	1
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	Europe’s ethanol producers use only home-grown crops that do not result in net decreases in exports of feed crops from Europe to the rest of the world.	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	Therefore, the amount of ILUC created from expansion of the renewable ethanol industry within Europe is exactly zero.	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	Farmers respond to biofuels mandates by growing more crops on the same land, and ethanol plants produce just as much high-protein animal feed as biofuel, in the process lowering imports of high-ILUC soymeal from South America, thereby serving to decrease net global ILUC.	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	The recent Biofuels – At What Cost?	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	report from the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), funded by NGOs, is the opening statement in a debate about the economics of EU biofuels.	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	This report was peer reviewed by peers with the same ideological biases and no academic qualifications in industrial and agricultural sciences.	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	The authors expressly prevented review by industry experts with appropriate academic credentials, on the pretext that industry reviewers would have leaked the report to the press.	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	Their report contains severe methodological errors, often contradicting IISD's own methodology and/or previous research.	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	The report also contains an array of material factual errors, the unavoidable consequence of a team effort that intentionally excludes both researchers and reviewers with practical knowledge of the report's subject matter.	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	The major problem with the IISD report is that it is almost entirely about excise tax exemptions, a subsidy paid to fuel suppliers.	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	With the introduction of the Renewable Energy Directive, member states now overwhelmingly use mandates to achieve their binding renewable transport energy obligations.	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	So, if they decide to pay fuel suppliers to buy biofuels through excise tax exemptions (such exemptions being a policy tool appropriate for the voluntary biofuels-blending policies of the past and simply redundant in the face of a binding mandate), then it's fuel suppliers that are skinning governments and consumers.	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	That’s why only a minority of Member States have such excise tax exemptions today and why those exemptions are quickly disappearing, facts conveniently omitted from IISD’s report.	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	Indeed, if all excise tax exemptions disappeared tomorrow, the EU biofuels industry would see its market stay the same as it is today.	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	Further correcting IISD's report to bring it into line with IISD's own definition of subsidy and its own prior work on the subject, we discover that the level of subsidy of ethanol in the EU is around €0.05/liter, an order of magnitude lower than suggested by IISD.	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	The same exercise also results in an ethanol carbon abatement cost of €58 per tonne and annual cost to EU society from ethanol (whose massive GHG savings, with or without ILUC, are not in question) of €614 million, numbers that suggest success and that we believe would be hard for any renewable energy source in Europe to beat.	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	They certainly beat any of the alternatives IISD suggests, namely more fossil fuels, advanced biofuels (whose abatement costs IISD does not calculate) or more fuel efficient cars with an abatement cost of €133 per tonne.	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	But don’t get us wrong, the ethanol industry is a huge proponent of higher fuel efficiency; those fuel efficient engines require high octane fuels, and ethanol is the safest and best octane enhancer, an industrial reality that highlights the dead ends in IISD’s efforts.	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	IISD’s favoured alternative to ethanol is a technology that requires ethanol.	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	Moreover, we note that the IISD study ignores our sector's GDP impact.	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	If we factor in such GDP increase using peer reviewed numbers and then use Eurostat data on tax payments, the resulting more-than-€3 billion in tax receipts annually by EU governments mean that ethanol is no longer a very good product whose cost is lower than other environmental reforms.	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	Rather, when GDP impacts are included, every tonne of CO2 abated by ethanol actually creates €216 million in new value (meaning that it more than pays for itself), and ethanol results in a net benefit in the EU of €2.6 billion annually.	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	These are amazing numbers, but, we stress, these are the numbers resulting from IISD’s own approach.	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	However, they are broadly consistent with other research.	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	For example, a recent study from PriceWaterhouseCoopers looked at the social-economic impact of bioethanol in France.	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	It showed a net gain for the French economy (after subtracting away subsidies) of €305 million.	89_9	0
O	Should you subsidize biofuels	So, let’s start asking serious questions about EU biofuel policy and subsidies.	89_9	0

O	Should we support animal rights	Since this capacity is, however, very useful for man's co-existence in a society, anyone who wilfully puts it at risk is in violation of an obligation to his fellow men.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Such arguments against animal cruelty are referred to as brutalisation arguments or pedagogical arguments.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	The understanding that the rough and cruel treatment of animals is not wrong per se, but only indirectly through the consequences for one's own moral character and the co-existence of mankind, was criticised early on, inter alia by Arthur Schopenhauer.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Numerous authors now consider it more plausible to suppose that harm caused to living creatures with a capacity for feeling is morally questionable as such and vis-à-vis the animals themselves.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	With this in mind they argue that an appropriate treatment of animals is a matter of justice, not compassion.	16_11	0

O	Should we support animal rights	Two theoretical models have emerged of late asserting that the moral status of humans and of animals with a capacity for feelings and/or interests is identical.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	These approaches, referred to as the animal interests position and the animal rights position, currently dominate the debate surrounding the appropriate treatment of animals.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	2.1.1 Animal interests position	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Peter Singer makes the moral status of living organisms dependent upon their capacity to have interests (for example in survival and freedom from pain).	16_11	0
C	Should we support animal rights	All living creatures that have interests in the same way have the same moral status.	16_11	1
O	Should we support animal rights	This view results in two consequences: an upward revaluation of the moral status of animals capable of having interests and a downward revaluation of the moral status of human organisms that are unable or have a reduced capacity to have interests.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Research on human embryos, for example, would no longer pose an ethical problem (since embryos do not yet have an interest in freedom from pain or survival), whereas painful experiments on mice would constitute a serious moral evil.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	In his book Animal Liberation Singer coins the phrase speciesism to describe the view that living creatures such as humans and mice with an equal interest in a pain-free existence could have such a different value that the one can be used to benefit the other.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	For Singer speciesism is a form of discrimination, just like racism or sexism: one group of living creatures is disadvantaged by another without the existence of any morally relevant reasons.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Speciesism is thus a form of group egoism of mankind directed against non-human creatures.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	What are the implications for the field of animal experiments?	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Singer does not support an absolute ban on animal experiments (in contrast to the proponents of animal rights).	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Nor does he speak out in favour of an absolute ban on experiments on humans.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Due to their self-awareness and awareness of the future (most) people, in Singer's assessment, have a stronger interest than animals in not being misused as research objects.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	What is more, humans attach significantly greater importance than animals to their own survival on account of their orientation towards the future Based on man's more extensive interests, Singer believes that to a certain extent the use of animals in biomedical experiments is more justified than the use of human subjects.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	However, Singer is of the opinion that in moral terms experiments conducted on humans who - due to a lack of cognitive and emotional faculties - have a limited capacity to have interests comparable to that of higher animals (for example infants or the severely mentally handicapped) are of an equal status to certain animal experiments.	16_11	0
C	Should we support animal rights	Singer's position is pathocentric, meaning that he calls for the attribution of an equal moral status to all living creatures with a capacity for feeling.	16_11	1
O	Should we support animal rights	Yet it has long been disputed whether animals are capable of feeling at all and, if so, the extent to which they have this capacity.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	In the modern era it was widely held that animals were incapable of thinking or feeling	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	2.1.2 Animal rights	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	In accordance with the rights view, as it is referred to by Tom Regan, its founder, the essential quality that a living organism must exhibit in order to be a bearer of rights is its being the subject of a life.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Every living creature with its own individual wellbeing has an inherent value and is therefore not merely a means for foreign ends.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	To this extent the animal interests position (see above) and animal rights position are similar.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	The call for animal rights , however, envisages further-reaching consequences than the call to take account of both animal interests and human interests.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	In contrast to the animal interests position, the rights position asserts that all living creatures that are the experiencing subject-of-a-life should be protected by individual rights.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	At stake here, then, is the question of whether the concept of rights - as it exists with respect to humans - can and should be extended to parts of the animal world.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Were animals to possess individual moral rights like humans, animal experiments would then be ruled out even if they promised an outstanding benefit - just as (forcibly conducted) experiments on humans are unacceptable under all circumstances irrespective of the benefit for the common good.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Proponents of a rights position therefore reject animal experiments just as they do the consumption of meat in general.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	One of the objections sometimes raised against the rights position is that rights as such only exist as a consequence of their mutual recognition (which animals are not capable of).	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Why should animals have rights if they lack insight into their significance and the possibility of acting accordingly?	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Animal rights supporters counter this objection with the argument from marginal cases: nor do human beings have to be morally capable and rational in order to be the bearers of rights (e.g.	16_11	0

O	Should we support animal rights	2.1.3 Compassion for animals	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	As the most prominent representative of ethics of compassion, Arthur Schopenhauer, differing from representatives of the animal interests and animal rights position, sets aside the attribution of a moral status.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	By doing so, compassion ethicists attempt to bypass presuppositions concerning commonly shared values such as human dignity.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	This is due to the fact that these presuppositions are to constitute moral statuses while they are at the same time not being accepted or cannot be accepted by everyone.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Similar to Singer, for Schopenhauer the circle of such members of a moral community who are worthy of protection is constituted of those beings capable of suffering.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	By means of her compassion with other creatures, the human being recognizes the worthiness for protection of the vis-à-vis and the responsibility to protect this vis-à-vis from suffering.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Living beings capable of suffering also include animals whose need for protection Schopenhauer nonetheless esteems to be lower than that of the human being.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	This owes to the fact that a living being’s ability to suffer is dependent upon its intelligence and that it is hence the human being who possesses the highest quality of suffering.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	According to this, meat consumption and the keeping of farm animals are legitimate as long as a death free of pain is warranted and the consumption is essential for survival, and, in the second case, the keeping of the animals is not excessive.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Schopenhauer generally objects animal experiments, which cause suffering for the animals.	16_11	0
C	Should we support animal rights	Analogously to the justification of meat consumption, he nonetheless allows for animal experiments if they cause almost no pain and are essential for the survival of the human being.	16_11	-1
O	Should we support animal rights	Based on Arthur Schopenhauer’s theory, Ursula Wolf developed the approach of a generalized compassion as an extension of the ethics of compassion.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Apart from values and the assignment of status, this approach is characterized by its attempt to justify rights and obligations for the reduction of suffering.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Schopenhauer had spared a justification of rights and obligations; for him, the basic rules of ethics are derived from compassion.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Wolf, by contrast, derives from compassion duties to protect concerning all living beings capable of suffering; this does, however, only apply to human beings since only human beings have at their disposal the necessary means for reflection for moral action.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	In comparison to Regans animal rights position, Wolf’s obligations rest on the foundation of compassion, while Regan links rights and obligations to the living beings‘ inherent value.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Those people are members of a moral community who have at their disposal the ability to suffer .	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	The higher dimension of protection of those living beings that have an, at least basal, self-conscience needs to be kept in mind.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Overall, Wolf refuses a differentiation in status between humans and animals by not considering the empirical rationales as substantive and by generally regarding all living beings capable of suffering as equally worthy of protection.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Concerning the issue of the legitimacy of animal experiments, the following standpoint arises in Wolf’s argumentation: The higher value of the human being based on empirical facts such as an allegedly higher ability to suffer due to her intelligence is rejected by Wolf as morally irrelevant; according to Wolf, they do not justify a gradation in status and hence no animal experiments which cause suffering to animals.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Similar to proponents of the animal rights position, approaches to the ethics of commission are oftentimes being criticized by means of the argument that moral consideration is only sensible concerning those living beings that are capable of moral consideration; this means that due to their capability, only human beings should be included in the circle of those that are directly worthy of protection.	16_11	0
C	Should we support animal rights	Wolf replies to this point that the specific capability of human beings to moral action should also be applied toward animals exactly because human beings have such capability at their disposal.	16_11	1
O	Should we support animal rights	2.1.4 Biocentrism	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Biocentrism asserts that all living organisms, i.e.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	not only those capable of having feeling and interests, are morally relevant and deserving of protection for their own sake.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Yet the unlimited protection of all life (the life of not only animals and plants, but also bacteria and other single-cell organisms) appears impossible.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	This may explain why there is hardly any call for unambiguous and radical measures in the context of biocentrism.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	The most well-known proponent of a biocentric position is Albert Schweitzer.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Schweitzer himself did not categorically reject animal experiments, but sought to appeal for a generally more gentle treatment of animals (and plants).	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	A middle position can be identified between the two extreme positions of animals do not have a genuine moral status (cf.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	1) and the moral status of animals and humans is the same (cf.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	2.1).	16_11	0
C	Should we support animal rights	2.2 The moral status of animals is subordinate to the moral status of humans	16_11	-1
O	Should we support animal rights	The theory that animals have their own moral status and that direct moral obligations therefore exist vis-à-vis animals, yet their moral status is as a matter of principle subordinate to the moral status of humans, is sometimes referred to as the double standard theory.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	The term double standard is intended to imply that while there are obligations towards both humans and animals, the respective obligations are different.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Although the double standard is in some ways difficult to justify (it cannot, for example, escape the reproach of speciesism, see above), this model nevertheless probably approximates most closely the everyday understanding of an appropriate relationship between humans and animals.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	While animals would be deserving of protection for their own sake under this theory, their interests (in freedom from pain, survival etc.)	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	would, however, - if they conflicted with human interests - be subordinate.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	All in all, this would give rise to an obligation to at least respect animals provided this did not infringe upon major human interests.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	At the same time, their use in scientific research (and also in the food industry) could be considered ethically acceptable overall.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	The Animal Protection Act, and in particular the requirement to demonstrate the indispensability and ethical acceptability of animal experiments, would appear to be roughly aligned with this understanding.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	The philosopher Jürgen Habermas submitted a suggestion of what the reasoning of such a position could be.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	He allows a genuine moral status to animals, which depends on the level of social interaction with humans.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	This seems to display well that the moral intuition of human behaviour is especially relevant towards more sophisticated animals.	16_11	0
O	Should we support animal rights	Also the animal protection act, especially the obligation to produce proof of indispensability as well as the ethical tenability of the animal experiments, approximately confirms this understanding.	16_11	0
