O	Dietterich and Horvitz note that this is already a concern for existing systems: An important aspect of any AI system that interacts with people is that it must reason about what people intend rather than carrying out commands literally.

In particular, in East Asian developing countries, GDP per head rose at 5.9% a year from 1975 to 2001 (according to 2003 Human Development Report[155] of UNDP).	12_2
E	Certain demographic changes in the developing world after active economic liberalization and international integration resulted in rising general welfare and, hence, reduced inequality.	Like this, the British economic journalist Martin Wolf says that incomes of poor developing countries, with more than half the world's population, grew substantially faster than those of the world's richest countries that remained relatively stable in its growth, leading to reduced international inequality and the incidence of poverty.	12_2

O	Internet gambling will drive network development;	I will focus on three factors:	45_10
O	Internet gambling will drive network development;	First, Internet technology renders prohibitionfutile.	45_10
O	Internet gambling will drive network development;	The Internet's inherently open architecture alreadyhobbles law enforcement officials, while relentless technologicalinnovation ensures that they will only fall farther and fartherbehind.	45_10
O	Internet gambling will drive network development;	Second, as an international network, theInternet offers an instant detour around merely domesticprohibitions.	45_10
O	Internet gambling will drive network development;	Principles of national sovereignty willprevent the U.S. from forcing other countries to enforce a ban onInternet gambling, and it takes only one safe harbor abroad toensure that U.S. citizens can gamble over the Internet.	45_10
O	Internet gambling will drive network development;	Third, consumer demand for Internet gamblingand the states' demand for tax revenue will create enormouspolitical pressure for legalization.	45_10
O	Internet gambling will drive network development;	The law enforcementcommunity, which has until recently enjoyed the media spotlight,will quickly find its calls for prohibition drowned out by theseand other political forces.	45_10
O	Internet gambling will drive network development;	Since the hard, cold facts about the inevitable failure ofprohibition will undoubtedly depress some decent andwell-intentioned people, I will leaven my analysis with somecomforting words about Internet gambling.	45_10

O	Internet gambling will drive network development;	Before launching into the details of why legalization will trumpthe prohibition of Internet gambling, and why that outcome shouldcause no great alarm, allow me to clear away a preliminaryobjection.	45_10
O	Internet gambling will drive network development;	Some proponents of a ban on Internet gambling argue thatif prohibition will not work then neither will any scheme ofregulation.	45_10
O	Internet gambling will drive network development;	(1)Such anargument fundamentally misunderstands a basic principle ofgovernance, however: Regulations can succeed evenwhere prohibition fails if they offer benefits that exceed theirburdens.	45_10

Just asreal-world casinos have competed to build the most innovative andappealing environments, so too will Internet gaming servicescompete to offer the flashiest graphics and most sophisticated userinterfaces.	45_10
O	Lastly, we should never forget that gamblers deserve all thebenefits that other consumers of entertainment servicesenjoy--including the benefits of competition.	That competition will, as a nice side-benefit, resultin broader bandwidth and better software for all sorts of Internetapplications.	45_10
O	Lastly, we should never forget that gamblers deserve all thebenefits that other consumers of entertainment servicesenjoy--including the benefits of competition.	Critics of real-world casinos fault them for luring consumersinto windowless caverns far from the real world, with gamblingtraps at every turn and free-flowing booze.	45_10
O	Lastly, we should never forget that gamblers deserve all thebenefits that other consumers of entertainment servicesenjoy--including the benefits of competition.	Regardless of thevalidity of such criticisms, they certainly do not apply toInternet gambling.	45_10
O	Lastly, we should never forget that gamblers deserve all thebenefits that other consumers of entertainment servicesenjoy--including the benefits of competition.	To the contrary, consumers who log on from homecomputers will find it impossible to escape phone calls, barkingdogs, and all the other distractions of the real world.Internet gambling thus offers a more wholesomeenvironment than its real-world counterpart.	45_10

E	Lastly, we should never forget that gamblers deserve all thebenefits that other consumers of entertainment servicesenjoy--including the benefits of competition.	By giving consumerscheap and easy access to a variety of gaming opportunities,the Internet will bring competition to an industrythat has long enjoyed the shelter of highly restrictive licensingpractices.	45_10
E	Lastly, we should never forget that gamblers deserve all thebenefits that other consumers of entertainment servicesenjoy--including the benefits of competition.	Gamblers will no longer have to fly to Las Vegasto play the slots, drive to the nearest authorized track to playthe horses, or even walk to the corner store to play the statelotto.	45_10

O	The majority of parents in American believe that sexual education is valuable.	Being an intuitive act and ingrained in our genes through evolution, learning about sex from an early age is not that important.	46_11
O	The majority of parents in American believe that sexual education is valuable.	However, knowing about sexual diseases and how to defend against sexual predators is essential.	46_11
O	The majority of parents in American believe that sexual education is valuable.	But, I believe that either parents should teach their children about sex at their own discretion, or individuals should investigate sexual education on their own terms, as teaching about this delicate subject against the will of parents is wrong, the internet is full of such information, and that nearly 80% of sexually-active students had sex before receiving formal sexual education.	46_11
E	The majority of parents in American believe that sexual education is valuable.	The majority of parents in American believe that sexual education is valuable.	46_11
E	The majority of parents in American believe that sexual education is valuable.	According to Leslie Kantor and Nicole Levitz, affiliates of Planned Parenthood, “More than 89 percent of parents that identified as Republicans or Democrats support including a wide range of topics in sex education including puberty, healthy relationships, abstinence, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and birth control in high school.	46_11

O	The majority of parents in American believe that sexual education is valuable.	However, I would argue that even though most parents have faith in sexual education, this system should not be imposed on parents who do not agree with the methods and information integrated into sexual education in high school and middle school.	46_11

O	The majority of parents in American believe that sexual education is valuable.	The US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health states that, “At the federal level, the U.S. congress has continued to substantially fund AOUM, and in FY 2016, funding was increased to $85 million per year” (Hall, Kelli Stidham, et al).	46_11
O	The majority of parents in American believe that sexual education is valuable.	With this much cash being put into the “abstinence only until marriage” sexual education, you would think that the results would be promising.	46_11

Studies show that people who have problems with self-esteem bring these difficulties into their couple relationship.	46_11
O	The difficulty for many parents who agree is that they feel teachers are better equipped to deal with the dramatic changes in sexual knowledge that have occurred among children of all ages.	It is surprising that opponents of RSE seem to ignore the relationship education dimension of RSE and focus, on the problems they perceive sex education causes.	46_11
O	The difficulty for many parents who agree is that they feel teachers are better equipped to deal with the dramatic changes in sexual knowledge that have occurred among children of all ages.	It is worrying when parents are told that school-based programmes in other countries have led to an enormous increase in premarital sex, teen promiscuity and teenage pregnancy.	46_11
O	The difficulty for many parents who agree is that they feel teachers are better equipped to deal with the dramatic changes in sexual knowledge that have occurred among children of all ages.	Figures from the Central Statistics Office here confirm that the same trends are happening among Irish teenagers before the introduction of mandatory RSE programmes.	46_11
O	The difficulty for many parents who agree is that they feel teachers are better equipped to deal with the dramatic changes in sexual knowledge that have occurred among children of all ages.	THE TRUTH IS young people world-wide are becoming sexually active at an earlier age.	46_11
O	The difficulty for many parents who agree is that they feel teachers are better equipped to deal with the dramatic changes in sexual knowledge that have occurred among children of all ages.	One reason for this is that girls and boys who reach puberty earlier are becoming sexually active sooner.	46_11
O	The difficulty for many parents who agree is that they feel teachers are better equipped to deal with the dramatic changes in sexual knowledge that have occurred among children of all ages.	The Catholic Primary School Managers' Association suggest that it is the duty, right and privilege of parents to give sex education.	46_11

Any adult who has tried to explain periods or nocturnal emissions to a reluctant 10- or 11-year-old knows how embarrassed and uncomfortable both parents and child can get in that situation.	46_11
E	The difficulty for many parents who agree is that they feel teachers are better equipped to deal with the dramatic changes in sexual knowledge that have occurred among children of all ages.	This embarrassment gets in the way of the honest communication, which is so important in acquiring knowledge and understanding of human sexuality and relationships.	46_11
O	The difficulty for many parents who agree is that they feel teachers are better equipped to deal with the dramatic changes in sexual knowledge that have occurred among children of all ages.	Adults who find it difficult to discuss sexual matters may be comforted to know that parent-child communication is far less important in influencing sexual behaviour than parental discipline and supervision.	46_11
O	The difficulty for many parents who agree is that they feel teachers are better equipped to deal with the dramatic changes in sexual knowledge that have occurred among children of all ages.	There is a strong relationship between diminished parental supervision and early sexual activity.	46_11
O	The difficulty for many parents who agree is that they feel teachers are better equipped to deal with the dramatic changes in sexual knowledge that have occurred among children of all ages.	Teen sexual activity is lowest in two-parent families where the girl has good communication with her mother.	46_11
O	The difficulty for many parents who agree is that they feel teachers are better equipped to deal with the dramatic changes in sexual knowledge that have occurred among children of all ages.	Surprisingly, there does not seem to be a parallel effect for boys.	46_11
O	The difficulty for many parents who agree is that they feel teachers are better equipped to deal with the dramatic changes in sexual knowledge that have occurred among children of all ages.	Teenagers with moderately strict parents have a lower level of sexual activity than those with very strict parents.	46_11
O	The difficulty for many parents who agree is that they feel teachers are better equipped to deal with the dramatic changes in sexual knowledge that have occurred among children of all ages.	Those with very permissive parents had the highest level, according to a study based on teenager's own reports.	46_11
O	The difficulty for many parents who agree is that they feel teachers are better equipped to deal with the dramatic changes in sexual knowledge that have occurred among children of all ages.	It is unrealistic to expect teachers to be more effective than parents in encouraging young people to delay sexual activity when they are passionately in love.	46_11

O	So yes, they are very similar in terms of the active ingredient.	Q: Why are brand names so much more expensive than generics?	61_6
O	So yes, they are very similar in terms of the active ingredient.	A: “Unlike the generic manufacturer, the original pharmaceutical company has to pay for more than just the actual production of that medication.	61_6
O	So yes, they are very similar in terms of the active ingredient.	The Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development estimates that the cost to develop and win marketing approval for a new drug is $2.6 billion.	61_6

Children with nonmedical exemptions are at increased risk for acquiring and transmitting vaccine-preventable diseases.34,35 In a retrospective cohort study based on nationwide surveillance data from 1985 through 1992, children with exemptions were 35 times as likely to contract measles as nonexempt children (relative risk, 35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 34 to 37).34 In a retrospective cohort study in Colorado based on data for the years 1987 through 1998, children with exemptions, as compared with unvaccinated children, were 22 times as likely to have had measles (relative risk, 22.2; 95% CI, 15.9 to 31.1) and almost six times as likely to have had pertussis (relative risk, 5.9; 95% CI, 4.2 to 8.2).35 Earlier data showed that lower incidences of measles and mumps were associated with the existence and enforcement of immunization requirements for school entry.12,36-38	70_9

O	“Dedicating land to bioenergy always comes at a cost because that land cannot produce plants for other purposes,” said Timothy Searchinger, a researcher at Princeton and the World Resources Institute and a co-writer of a recent report that calls for a rollback of crops dedicated to biofuels.	It certainly looks that way, judging from the aggressive mandates governments around the globe have set to incorporate bioenergy into their transportation fuels in the hope of limiting the world’s overwhelming dependence on gasoline and diesel to move people and goods.	89_10

O	Intellectual property rights should not be seen as an alternative to competition, but rather as essential to enable competition in factors such as innovation and quality.	In my view, this assessment results from too high an expectation of what should be achieved by patents or other intellectual property.	120_9
O	Intellectual property rights should not be seen as an alternative to competition, but rather as essential to enable competition in factors such as innovation and quality.

O	Intellectual property rights should not be seen as an alternative to competition, but rather as essential to enable competition in factors such as innovation and quality.	Similarly, in the field of competition law, commentators suppose that it is necessary to balance the innovation promoted by intellectual property against the competition safeguarded by competition law.	120_9
O	Intellectual property rights should not be seen as an alternative to competition, but rather as essential to enable competition in factors such as innovation and quality.	This approach tends to be too strict on intellectual property rights.	120_9
O	Intellectual property rights should not be seen as an alternative to competition, but rather as essential to enable competition in factors such as innovation and quality.	In order to justify them and their exploitation on this basis it is necessary to show that they actually achieve an increase in innovation.	120_9
O	Intellectual property rights should not be seen as an alternative to competition, but rather as essential to enable competition in factors such as innovation and quality.	By contrast for competition law to apply there is no need to show that its intervention would actually result in improvements in efficiency, only that it is necessary to maintain competition.	120_9

O	Intellectual property rights should not be seen as an alternative to competition, but rather as essential to enable competition in factors such as innovation and quality.	So there is not really a need to reconcile a conflict between the protection of intellectual property and competition, but rather a need to find a balance between different forms of competition.	120_9
O	Intellectual property rights should not be seen as an alternative to competition, but rather as essential to enable competition in factors such as innovation and quality.

O	Intellectual property rights should not be seen as an alternative to competition, but rather as essential to enable competition in factors such as innovation and quality.	And whether that is the case can generally be tested by comparing competition in all aspects (including innovation and quality) resulting from the conduct in issue with the competition that would otherwise exist, taking into account the existence, ownership and justified scope of the intellectual property rights (the counterfactual).	120_9
